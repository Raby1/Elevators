Project: Elevator System

Description:

This project involves two main components:

Elevator: The elevator represents the physical unit that transports passengers between floors.

Floor: Each floor has the functionality to request an elevator. The system will assign an available elevator to the requested floor.

Functionality:

Floor Request: When a user on a floor presses the elevator call button, the system identifies the floor and sends a request to the elevator control system.

Elevator Assignment: The elevator control system receives floor requests from all floors. It determines the most efficient route and assigns an available elevator to the requested floor.

Elevator Movement: The assigned elevator moves to the requested floor, stopping to allow passengers to enter or exit.
